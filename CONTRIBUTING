# Contributing to the Backstage Dora Plugin

Thank you for considering contributing to the Backstage Dora Plugin! We're excited to have you on board.

## Code of Conduct

We follow the standard open-source code of conduct. Please be respectful and considerate in your interactions with the community.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please make sure you have the following:

* Node.js
* npm or yarn
* A code editor or IDE of your choice

## Coding Style and Practices

We follow standard JavaScript and React coding practices. Please make sure to:

* Use consistent indentation and spacing.
* Use clear and descriptive variable names.
* Use functions and modules to organize your code.
* Keep your code concise and readable.

### Using `pre-commit`

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that our code is formatted consistently and follows good coding practices. Run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks. After installation, `pre-commit` will run automatically against your changes on every commit. You can also run `pre-commit run --all-files` to manually run the hooks on all files.

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please make sure to write tests for any new features or bug fixes you contribute.
